            <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>4cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil
                and flour three 9 by 1 1/2-inch round cake pans</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour,sugar,
                baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. In another large
                bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs,
                food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Using a standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients into
                the wet ingredients until just combined and a smooth
                batter is formed.</li>
            <li>Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake
                pans. Place the pans in the oven evenly space apart.
                Bake, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking,
                until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans,
                and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes
                comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around
                the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans.
                One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then
                re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up.
                Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Frost the cake. Place 1 layer, rounded-side down,
                in the middle of a rotating cake stand. Using a palette
                knife or offset spatula spread some of the Cream Cheese
                Frosting over the top of the cake. Carefully set
                another layer on top, rounded-side down,and repeat.
                Top with the remaining layer and cover the entire cake
                with the remaining frosting, Sprinkle the top with the
                pecans.</li>
            <li>In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
                or with a hand-held electric mixer in a large bowl,
                mix the cream cheese,sugar, and butter on low speed
                until incorporated. Increase the speed to high, and mix
                until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the vanilla,
                raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy.
                Store in the refrigerator until somewhat stiff, before
                using. May be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.</li>
